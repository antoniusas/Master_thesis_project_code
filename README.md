# Master_thesis_project_code
Files used on my master-thesis, code will be added to repository after cleaning and documentation of the code. The code will be publically available and open source. Everyone who wishes to use it as either personal or research-related topics are free to do so. 

As it is open source, the author of the code would be greatly appreciated if you credit him :)
